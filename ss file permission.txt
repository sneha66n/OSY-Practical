	then
		if [ -x "$line" ]
	        then
			echo "$line"
			fi
		fi
done
rm f



2) Write a shell script which displays a list of all the files in the current directory to which user has read, write and execute permission.

#!/bin/bash

pwd
ls > f
exec < f
while read line
do
    # Check if it's a file
    if [ -f "$line" ]
    then
        # Check if the file has read, write, and execute permissions
        if [ -r "$line" -a -w "$line" -a -x "$line" ]
        then
            # Print the file name if it has all permissions
            echo "$line has all the permissions"
        fi
    fi
done
