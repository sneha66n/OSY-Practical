Write a shell script which accepts input as a file or directory and displays message whether it is file or directory.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter file or directory name"
read file

if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "$file is a file"
elif [ -d "$file" ]; then
    echo "$file is a directory"
else
    echo "$file is neither a file nor a directory"
fi
