4. Write a file handling program. First check whether it is file or directory, then if it is file the program shall ask user for choices of copying, removing and remaining files. Use case statement.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter file or directory name:"
read file
if [ -d "$file" ]; then
    echo "It is a directory"
elif [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "Enter your choice:"
    echo "1. Copy file"
    echo "2. Rename file"
    echo "3. Remove file"
    read ch

    case "$ch" in
        1)
            echo "Enter the new file name to copy to:"
            read cpfile
            cp "$file" "$cpfile"
            echo "File copied from $file to $cpfile"
            ;;
        2)
            echo "Enter the new name for the file:"
            read newname
            mv "$file" "$newname"
            echo "$file has been renamed to $newname"
            ;;
        3)
            rm "$file"
            echo "$file has been removed"
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid choice"
            ;;
    esac
else
    echo "Error: $file is neither a file nor a directory"
fi
